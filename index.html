                        <h3>Tokyo</h3><p>It's one of the leading technological hubs of the world and has very innovative people and
                                companies.
                                Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional,
                                from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine
                                is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits
                                amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from
                                classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater
                                (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum). Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to), one of the 47 prefectures
                                of Japan, has served as the Japanese capital since 1869. As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo
                                Area
                                ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world. The urban area houses the
                                seat
                                of the Emperor of Japan, of the Japanese government and of the National Diet. Tokyo
                                forms
                                part of the Kantō region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and
                                includes
                                the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa
                                Ieyasu
                                made the city his headquarters in 1603. It became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved
                                his seat
                                to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis
                                formed
                                in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of
                                Tokyo
                                (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and
                                governed
                                as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of a city and a
                                prefecture,
                                a characteristic unique to Tokyo.</p>

                                        <p>On the square is Groote Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church), which has stood here
                                                since
                                                1704. The site was originally an abandoned garden plot at the bottom end
                                                of the
                                                Company Gardens. Back in those days Spin Street was referred to as Plein
                                                Straat,
                                                or even Kleine Plein Straat. The interesting aspects to Church Square
                                                are the
                                                invisible bits of history. For instance, the square once functioned as a
                                                slave
                                                market connected to the Slave Lodge (built in 1679 and thus a
                                                contemporary of
                                                Groote Kerk), which lies just west of the square and is a very important
                                                part of
                                                the Cape's history. Between 1730 and 1753 Church Square became a meeting
                                                place
                                                for local dogs. They became such a menace for church goers that the city
                                                employed a dog-whipper to stop them harassing those attending church
                                                (historians
                                                believe the dog menace was directly related to the small pox epidemics
                                                of 1713
                                                and 1750 when, at the church graveyard, bodies piled up at a rather

                                                rate). The graveyard was thought to extend towards Longmarket Street. A

                                                factory used to lie on Church Square's eastern boundary, and a slave
                                                tree once
                                                stood in the square, a place for slaves to wait whilst their owners went
                                                to
                                                church. The tree was removed in 1916 but the space remains commemorated.

                                                country's tumultuous history. From 1910 to 1994, it was elected mainly

                                                is in Pretoria. This dates back to the foundation of the Union, when
                                                there was
                                                disagreement among the four provinces as to which city would be the
                                                national
                                                capital. As a compromise, Cape Town was designated the legislative
                                                capital,
                                                Bloemfontein the judicial capital, and Pretoria the administrative
                                                capital. The

                                                servants and diplomats must move back and forth when Parliament is in

                                        <p>The Slave Lodge is one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town. The building has
                                                answered to many names in the last three centuries, namely; Slave Lodge,

                                                All these names reflect the long and rich history of the building. In
                                                1998 this
                                                museum was renamed the Slave Lodge. Under the umbrella theme, ‘From

                                                the long
                                                history of slavery in South Africa. Through our changing, temporary
